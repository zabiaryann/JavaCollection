	/* HashMaps:
	 * are similar to Arrays and ArrayLists, in that they're a 
	 * collection of data.While Arrays are stored by index,
	 * HashMaps store data as "key"/"value" pairs.*/
	
	
	
	/* forEach and Map.Entry Exercises.
	 * Ask the user for 5 numbers and store them in an array list.
	 * Then find the sum, product, largest, and smallest of those numbers.
	 * 
	 * 2. You are a car dealer - create a hash map of vehicles:
	 * The model is the Key, the make is the Value.
	 * Ask the customer what car (model) they are looking for,use the HashMap to 
	 * determine if you have that vehicle, and what make it is.
	 * (e.g., "Oh, you're looking for a Civic? Our Honda selection is right 
	 * over here...")*/
	
	
	/* LinkedList: 
	 * In Java, a LinkedList is a very important data structure 
	 * because it serves as a template for other structures.LinkedLists consist 
	 * of many objects with references to other objects. Because of this structure, 
	 * LinkedLists are not indexed.The LinkedList itself functions as a container 
	 * for its nodes, the objects which make up the list. This container object 
	 * keeps track of the first and the last object in the list. It uses reference 
	 * variables to point to these objects
	 * 
	 * Each object within the list has a next variable (or field) which references 
	 * the proceeding object in the list.The object that is first, will hold a 
	 * reference to the object that is second, the second to the third, etc.
	 * But what about the last object in the list? What can it point to in its 
	 * next field? The answer is nothing, so it points to null
	 * */
	
	/*Queues:
	 * First In, First Out: Whoever joins the line first will leave the 
	 * line first.Objects are added to the back​ and removed from the front.
	 * When adding and removing from a queue, we call it enqueuing and 
	 * dequeuing. Each data structure has a different name for adding and 
	 * removing objects.​Queues have references to their first and last 
	 * objects, and each object has a reference to the next one
	 * Queue acts as an interface rather than an actual object.We can't 
	 * instantiate an interface, but we can create an instance of LinkedList
	 * and assign it to a Queue interface*/
	
	/* Stack:
	 * In Java, a "stack" is a linear data structure that follows the 
	 * Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last element 
	 * added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are commonly used 
	 * in various programming scenarios, such as managing function calls in a 
	 * program, parsing expressions, and implementing undo functionality in 
	 * applications.*/
